Chaotic Modules for vcv rack

# Frac
Why not use fractal signals as vcos?
Is there an aesthetic characteristic in *fractalistic* signals?

This idea is explored with **Frac** a fractal vco that generates signals of two types:

- [takagi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blancmange_curve`)
- [Weierstrass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass_function)

# Attractor
Why not use chaotic attractors for modulating signals?

For that we developed almost all teh attractors found [here](https://examples.pyviz.org/attractors/attractors.html), namely:
- Clifford
- De_Jong
- Svensson
- Bedhead
- Dream
- HopalongA
- HopalongB
-	Gumowski_Mira


I'am new in audio-synthesis with vcv-rack so all patches are under development.
I will be happy to receive comments and concerns if any.
